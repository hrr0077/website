                <h2>Welcome Back !</h2>
                <p>We are now open again, with a surprisingly large number of students. Here in the India life is beginning to return to normal
                    .It is quite easy for some people to travel to the India and to join our school, and each week many new students enrol. You 
                    can also get a free Covid-19 vaccination when you are here.First, you need to know if your home country is in the India's Red 
                    list. See <a href=https://www.gov.in/covid-19-guideline> https://www.gov.in/covid-19-guideline</a> Our mission is to provide 
                    the vista of elementry education to the deserving students coming from socially, economically backward and underprivileged 
                    communities of this region, particularly the Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes and other Backward Communities. Preference is
                    given to students from these communities. However, since the college is situated in the heart of Ranchi (Jharkhand, India), 
                    students of other communities and regions may also apply. </p>
